I am Iniye Anthony, a student in GV300 with a strong interest in political data analysis and experimental research methods. My work focuses on understanding how political messaging influences behaviour using statistical modelling and causal inference techniques.

Through my coursework, I have developed practical experience in R, including data simulation, regression analysis, and data visualisation using ggplot2. I am particularly interested in how quantitative methods can be applied to real-world political communication and public opinion research.

This website showcases selected work that demonstrates my ability to design experiments, estimate Average Treatment Effects, and communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
